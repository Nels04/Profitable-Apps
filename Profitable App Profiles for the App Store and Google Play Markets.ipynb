    "* This project is about analysing data sets(about apps) from the Google Play store and the Apple Store. The company only builds apps that are free to download and install and the main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. The revenue is influenced by the number of people who use their apps.\n",

    "   * The first goal is to analyze data in order to help developers and the company what type of apps are likely to attract more users.\n",
    "   * The second goal which is more personal, is to help get a better understanding or become more comfortable with the fundamnetals of Python.\n",
    "   \n",
    "There are over 2 million apps in the Apple store and 2.1 million in the Google(Android) store. Collecting and analysing that data of 4 million apps requires time and money. That is why we'll work with 2 data sets that were found at no cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. The data set from Google play we're going to use contains around 10,000 apps. The data was collected in August 2018. You can have access to the data set from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps)\n",
